This will be a Haskell Library Package for doing UTP semantics calculations

If you want a version of the code compatible with the UTP2016 paper
then checkout the 'submit' tag.


### How do I get set up? ###

For now just clone, go into /src and run
> ghci UTPCalcMAIN.lhs

For now this code may not compile -- this will be marked
DNC (Does Not Compile) in the commit message
or SDNC (Still does not compile).

Eventually it'll get cabal'd (and eventually stack'd?).

### Contribution guidelines ###

Give me a while....
