		 embedding within a general-purpose host language. This
		 embedding may be deep or shallow, depending on whether
		 terms in the language construct syntactic or semantic
		 representations. The deep and shallow styles are
		 closely related, and intimately connected to folds; in
		 this paper, we explore that connection.",
