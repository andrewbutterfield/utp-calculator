\subsection*{Paper Plan - 20 page limit}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Discuss future plans: formal release as a Haskell library;
    REPL customization; rendering options: \LaTeX, UTP2, Isabelle/UTP\cite{DBLP:conf/utp/FosterZW14}.
    (\S\ref{sec:Future})
  \item
    Sometimes a step attempt returns \texttt{(Bool,MPred s)},
    sometmes it's \texttt{(String,MPred s)}. Shouldn't this be regularised?
  \item
    The deep/shallow embedding linkage\cite{Gibbons:2014:FDS} may be of interest.
\end{itemize}
