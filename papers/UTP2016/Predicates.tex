\subsection{Coding Atomic Semantics}

Formally, using our shorthand notations, we define atomic behaviour as:
\[
    \A(A) \defs ls(in) \land A \land ls'=ls\ominus(in,out)
\]
where $A$ is a predicate whose alphabet is restricted to $s$ and $s'$.
We code this up as follows:
\begin{code}
patm mpr = comp "A" [mpr] -- we assume mpr has only s, s' free

defnAtomic d [a] = ldefn shPAtm $ mkAnd [lsin,a,ls'eqlsinout]

inp = Var "in" -- 'in' is a Haskell keyword
out = Var "out"
lsin = atm $ App "subset" [inp,ls]
lsinout = App "sswap" [ls,inp,out]
ls'eqlsinout = equal ls' lsinout

patmEntry
 = ( nPAtm
   , PredEntry [] ppPAtm [] defnAtomic (pNoChg nPAtm) )
\end{code}
Here \texttt{atm} lifts an expression to a marked predicate,
while \texttt{"sswap"} names the ternary operation $\_\ominus(\_,\_)$,
and \texttt{equal} is the marked form of \texttt{Equal}.


We won't show the encoding of the composite constructs,
or a predicate transformer called $run$ that actually
enables us to symbolically `execute' our semantics.
We will show how the \texttt{pprint} entry for
sequential composition in UTCP is defined,
just to show how easy support for infix notation is.
\begin{code}
ppPSeq d ms p [mpr1,mpr2]
 = paren p precPSeq -- parenthesise if precedence requires it
     $ ppopen  (pad ";;") [ mshowp d ms precPSeq mpr1
                          , mshowp d ms precPSeq mpr2 ]
\end{code}
Here \texttt{pad} puts spaces around its argument,
while \texttt{ppopen} uses its first argument as a
separator between all the elements of its second list argument.
The function \texttt{mshowp} is the top-level predicate printer.

\subsubsection{Predicate Entries}~

\begin{code}
Entry s
  = ...
  | PredEntry
    { pcansub :: [String]
    , pprint :: Dict s -> MarkStyle -> Int -> [MPred s] -> PP
    , alfa :: [String]
    , pdefn :: Rewrite s
    , prsimp :: Rewrite s }
type Rewrite s = Dict s -> [MPred s] -> (String, Pred s)
\end{code}
The predicate entry associated with Comp name pargs
has five fields:
\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{pcansub}]
    does for predicates what \texttt{ecansub} does for expressions.
  \item[\texttt{pprint}]
    is similar to \texttt{eprint} except it has two extra arguments,
    used to help with special renderings for predicates marked as changed,
    and precedence levels for managing bracketing.
    We do pretty-printing tricks such as indenting and adding line-breaks
    at the predicate level.
  \item[\texttt{alfa}]
    is used to identify the alphabet of the predicate.
  \item[\texttt{pdefn}]
    is a function invoked when \texttt{name} has a definition,
    and we want to expand it.
  \item[\texttt{prsimp}]
    is called by the simplifier when processing \texttt{name}.
\end{description}
Both \texttt{pdefn} and \texttt{prsimp} take a dictionary argument
and list of sub-component (marked)predicates,
returning a string/predicate pair,
interpreted in a manner similar to \texttt{eval} above.
