My affiliation is incorrect - you have  the original line from
Trinity College Dublin   to Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland

The name of my institution for academic accreditation purposes is "Trinity College Dublin" - no comma between College and Dublin

You can have  "Trinity College Dublin, Ireland"  if you want.

On p5, the sentence just before the numbered listing (7th line) has a typo after the opening parenthesis "(he prompt..."
This should be "(the prompt ..."

On p13, 2nd line after code snippet at top    - spaces have been removed in a string

In proof:  and so its use here is equivalent to ppa ";;", while ....

In submitted paper: and so its use here is equivalent to ppa " ;; ", while ....

The spaces in the quoted string around the ;; are important and should be re-inserted as the illustrate the behaviour of 'pad'
which puts blanks around its arguments.
