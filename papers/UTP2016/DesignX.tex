\subsubsection{Alphabet Entries}~

\begin{code}
Entry s
  = ...
  | AlfEntry  { avars :: [String]}
\end{code}
Most simply put, an alphabet is simply a set of variables.
In any UTP theory we typically have well-defined alphabets,
often with particular subsets of interest,
such as all the ``before'' observations (undashed variables),
or ``after'' observations (dashed variables).
We give these subsets standardised names,
and use the dictionary to list the relevant variables.
