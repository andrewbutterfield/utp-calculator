A very early decision was made to adhere to Agile Software development
principles \cite{Fowl01a}
in developing this calculator
(to the extent possible given that the roles of Software Engineer, Scrum Manager
and Customer were all rolled into one).
In particular we stuck close to the YAGNI (``Ya Ain't Gonna Need It'') principle%
\footnote{More formally, ``Simplicity---the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done---is essential.''}
which requires us to only write software for a function
that is required at that time.
This does not prevent advanced design planning but does keep
the development focussed on immediate needs.
So initially the focus was on being able to use the calculator
to expand the UTP definition of an atomic action.
Once that was working, then the focus shifted to additional code to
support the calculation of the sequential composition of two atomic actions,
and so on.
For example, the feature to take a final calculation and output it to a file
was only developed when this paper was being written,
because there was no need for it until this point.
