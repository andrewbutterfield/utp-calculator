\begin{itemize}
  \item
     explain the key design decisions,
     and how these were motivated by agile software development
     principles (esp. YAGNI). (\S\ref{sec:Design})
     Such decisions include
     \begin{itemize}
       \item dictionaries --- originally to support tailored rendering
       \item taking pretty-printing seriously
       \item relying on simple hand-proved (algebraic!) laws
       \item the avoidance of quantifiers,
        and how this forces us to deal with substitutability
       \item deciding to add a save-to-file option
        just in time to produce material for this paper
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
