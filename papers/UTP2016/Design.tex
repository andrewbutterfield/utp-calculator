\section{Design \& Architecture}\label{sec:Design}

\subsection{Key Design Decisions}

Taking into account the repetitive nature of the calculations,
and the need for shorthand notations we very rapidly converged
on four initial design decisions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item All calculation objects are written
  directly in Haskell, to avoid having to implement a parser.
  \item The expression and predicate datatype declarations
   would be very simple, with only equality being singled out.
  \item Provide a good way to pretty-print long predicates
    that made it easy to see their overall structure
  \item Rely on a dictionary based system to
    make it easy to customise how specific constructs
    were to be handled.
\end{enumerate}
From our experience with the \UTP2 theorem-prover we also decided
the following regarding the calculation steps that would be supported:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    We would not support full  propositional calculus
    or theories of numbers or sets.
    Instead we would support the use of hard-coded relevant laws,
    typically derived from a handwritten proof.
  \item
    We would avoid, at all costs,
    any use of quantifiers or binding constructs.
  \item
    The calculator user interface would be very simple,
    supporting a few high level commands such as ``simplify''
    or ``reduce''.
    In particular,
    no facility would be provided for the user to identify
    the relevant sub-part of the current goal to which any operation
    should be applied.
    Instead the tool would use a systematic sweep through the predicate
    to find the first applicable calculation step of the requested kind,
    and apply that.
    Our subsequent experience with the calculator indicates
    that this was a good choice.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The Calculator REPL}

The way the calculator is designed to be used is
that a function implementing a calculator Read-Execute-Print-Loop (REPL)
is given a dictionary and starting predicate as inputs.
Calculator commands include an ability to undo previous steps ('\texttt{u}'),
request help ('\texttt{?}'),
and to signal an exit from the calculator ('\texttt{x}').
However,
of most interest are the five calculation commands.
The first is a global simplify command ('\texttt{s}'),
that scans the entire predicate from the bottom-up
looking for simplifiers for each composite and applying them.
Simplifiers are captured as \texttt{eval} or \texttt{prsimp} components
in dictionary entries.

The other four commands work by searching top-down, left-to-right for
the first sub-component for which the relevant dictionary calculator
function returns a changed result.
Here is where we have a reduced degree of control,
which simplifies the REPL dramatically,
but has turns out to be effective in practice.

Here is a sample run obtained when calculating the effect of
the $run(\A(A) \pseq \A(B))$, from the introduction.
For convenience we predefined the predicate $\A(A) \pseq \A(B)$ in Haskell as
\begin{verbatim}
athenb = pseq [patm (PVar "A"),patm (PVar "B")]
\end{verbatim}
Here \texttt{PVar} is a constructor of the predicate datatype \texttt{Pred}
(See \S\ref{sec:Predicates}),
while \texttt{pseq} and \texttt{patm} are convenient functions we wrote
to build instances
of $\pseq$ and $\A(\_)$ respectively.
We then invoked the calculator as follows,
where \texttt{dictUTCP} is the dictionary for this theory:
\begin{verbatim}
calcREPL dictUTCP (run athenb)
\end{verbatim}
and proceed to interact
(here the prompt  ``\texttt{ ?,d,r,l,s,c,u,x :-}''
shows the available commands)

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, numbers=left, numberstyle=\tiny, numbersep=5pt]
run(A(A) ;; A(B))
 ?,d,r,l,s,c,u,x :- d
 = "defn. of run.3"
   (A(A) ;; A(B))[g::,lg,lg,lg:/g,in,ls,out]
 ; ~ls(lg:) * (A(A) ;; A(B))[g::,lg,lg:/g,in,out]
 ?,d,r,l,s,c,u,x :- d
 = "defn. of ;;"
   (A(A)[g:1,lg/g,out] \/
   A(B)[g:2,lg/g,in])[g::,lg,lg,lg:/g,in,ls,out]
 ; ~ls(lg:) * (A(A) ;; A(B))[g::,lg,lg:/g,in,out]
 ?,d,r,l,s,c,u,x :- s
 = "simplify"
   A(A)[g:::1,lg,lg,lg::/g,in,ls,out] \/
   A(B)[g:::2,lg::,lg,lg:/g,in,ls,out]
 ; ~ls(lg:) * (A(A) ;; A(B))[g::,lg,lg:/g,in,out]
.... 10 more steps
A /\ ls' = {lg::} ; B /\ ls' = {lg:}
 ?,d,r,l,s,c,u,x :- r
 = "ls'-cleanup"
(A ; B) /\ ls' = {lg:}
\end{lstlisting}
Lines 2, 6, 11, and 18 show the user entering a single key command at the prompt.
Lines 3, 7, and 19 show a short string identifying the relevant definition
or law.
Lines 1, 4--5, 8--10, 17 and 20 show various stages of the calculation.
%The user simply indicates the broad class of command required,
%and the calculator works on the current goal predicate.
%A text transcript is produced,
%which is essentially the above
%without the prompts.
%The marking facility, requiring the \texttt{Pred}/\texttt{MPred} complication,
%is currently used when displaying the transcript in a terminal
%window to highlight old and new parts of predicates as changes are made.
%Currently this only works well on the Mac OS X terminal,
%because it seems to be the only one that properly supports ANSI escape sequences.



\subsection{Pretty-Printing}\label{ssec:pp}

For the calculator output,
it is very important that it be readable,
as many of the predicates get very large,
particularly at intermediate points of the calculation.
For this reason, a lot of effort was put into the development
of both good pretty-printing,
and ways to highlight old and new parts of predicates as changes are made.
The key principle was to ensure that whenever a predicate
had to split over multiple lines,
that the breaks are always around the top-most operator or composition
symbol, with sub-components indented in, both after and \emph{before}.
An example of such pretty-printing in action is

\noindent
\includegraphics[scale=0.155]{pprint-xmpl.eps}

%{\small
%\begin{verbatim}
%    D(out)
% \/ (      ~ls(out)
%        /\ (D(lg) \/ A(in,lg,a,in,lg,lg) \/ D(out) \/ A(lg,out,b,lg,out,out))
%     ; W(D(lg) \/ A(in,lg,a,in,lg,lg) \/ D(out) \/ A(lg,out,b,lg,out,out)))
%\end{verbatim}
%}
\noindent
The top-level structure of this is
$D(out) \lor ( (\lnot ls(out) \land \dots) ; W(\dots) )$
where the precedence ordering from tightest to loosest is $\land,\seq,\lor$.

\noindent
The pretty printing support can be found in \texttt{PrettyPrint.lhs},
which was written from scratch, but inspired by writings of
Hughes\cite{HughesJohn1995c} and Wadler\cite{wadler-pp}
on the subject.
In addition to the layout management aspects of pretty-printing
as just illustrated above,
there is also a need for a support for shorthand notations.
We illustrate this in Sect.\ref{sec:Expressions}.


%The standard approach is that the calculator
%will seek information regarding some name that is
%currently of interest.
%It will perform a dictionary lookup which can result
%in either failure, for which a suitable default action will be used,
%or success, in which case the dictionary entry will supply
%information to guide the required name-specific behaviour.
%
%There are four kinds of dictionary entries,
%one each for expressions and predicates,
%one for laws of various kinds,
%and one for alphabet handling.
%We will discuss each kind in turn,
%but leave examples of their use until Sect.\ref{sec:Theorising}.
