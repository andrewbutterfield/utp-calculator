\section{Dictionaries}\label{sec:Dictionaries}

The approach taken is to provide a dictionary that maps names
to entries that supply extra information.
The names can be those of expression or predicate composites,
or correspond to variables, and a few other features of note.
All of the main calculator functions are driven by this
dictionary,
and the correct definition of dictionary entries
is the primary way for users to set up calculations.
The dictionary datatype (\texttt{Dict s}),
parameterised with a generic type \texttt{s},
is critical to the functioning of the calculator.
\begin{verbatim}
type Dict s = M.Map String (Entry s)
-- M is the renamed import of Data.Map
\end{verbatim}
It is the basic way in which the user of the calculator
describes the alphabet, definitions and laws associated with their theory.

The dictionary uses the Haskell \texttt{String} datatype for keys,
and contains four different kinds of entries: alphabets,
expressions, predicates and laws.
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
data Entry s = AlfEntry .. | ExprEntry .. | PredEntry .. | LawEntry ..
\end{verbatim}
}
For simplicity, there is only one namespace involved,
and some names are reserved for special purposes.
These are listed in Fig. \ref{fig:rsvd-names}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
%\begin{verbatim}
\texttt{Alf Obs Obs' Mdl Mdl' Scr Scr' Dyn Dyn' Stc laws}
%\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Reserved Dictionary Names}\label{fig:rsvd-names}
\end{figure}
There are ten names that describe different
(overlapping)
parts of the theory alphabet (Fig. \ref{fig:rsvd-names}).
While it is possible to define these individually,
this can be quite error-prone,
so a function is provided to construct all these entries
from three basic pieces of information:
program variable names (`script', \texttt{Scr});
auxiliary variable names (`model',\texttt{Mdl}),
e.g. variables like $ls$ that don't represent variable values,
but instead some other observable program property of interest);
and static parameter variable names (\texttt{Stc}).
\begin{verbatim}
stdAlfDictGen :: [String] -> [String] -> [String] -> Dict s
\end{verbatim}
All lists contain undashed names, with dashes added when required
by the function.
So, the alphabet entries for the UTCP theory are defined as follows:
\begin{code}
dictAlpha = stdAlfDictGen ["s"] ["ls"] ["g","in","out"]
\end{code}
All of these entries will be of kind \texttt{AlfEntry},
i.e, just lists of the relevant variables.
\begin{verbatim}
   AlfEntry { avars  :: [String]}
\end{verbatim}
There are two important utility functions,
one that builds dictionaries from lists of string/entry pairs,
and another that merges two dictionaries, resolving conflicts
by merging entries if possible, otherwise favouring the
second dictionary:
\begin{verbatim}
makeDict :: [(String, Entry s)] -> Dict s
dictMrg :: Dict s -> Dict s -> Dict s
\end{verbatim}
