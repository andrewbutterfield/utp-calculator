We present the development of the UTP-Calculator:
a tool, written in Haskell,
that supports rapid prototyping of new theories
by supporting an easy way to very quickly perform calculations.
The emphasis during the calculator development
was keeping it simple but effective,
and relying on the user to have the expertise to check its output.
It is not intended to supplant existing theorem prover or language
transformation technology.
The tool is designed for someone who is both very familiar with UTP
theory construction, and familiar enough with Haskell to be able to write
pattern-matching code. In this paper we describe how this tool can be used
to assist in theory development, by describing the key components
of the calculator and how various aspects such a theory
might be encoded.
We finish with a discussion of our experience in using the tool.
