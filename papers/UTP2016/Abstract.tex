We present the development of the UTP-Calculator:
a tool, written in Haskell,
that supports rapid prototyping of new theories
by supporting an easy way to very quickly perform calculations.
The tool is designed for someone who is both very familiar with UTP
theory construction, and familiar enough with Haskell to be able to write
pattern-matching code. In this paper we describe how this tool can be used
to assist in theory development, by walking through how such a theory
might be encoded.
