\section{Building TheoriesX}\label{sec:TheorisingX}

%Sometimes learning by doing is the best approach,
%so here we sketch out how a theory like UTCP
%is captured in way that this calculator
%can be usefully used to perform validating calculations.

We now present extracts from a theory built using this
approach to illustrate how the calculator is used.
As already stated,
the use of this calculator does require some expertise
in functional programming with languages that support
pattern-matching (e.g. Haskell, ML).
We do this by giving an overview of the Haskell encoding
of the UTCP theory
that was the motivation for this work.
The emphasis here is on how to encode a UTP theory for use with this
calculator,
rather than trying to explain the theory itself, or its design motivation.
