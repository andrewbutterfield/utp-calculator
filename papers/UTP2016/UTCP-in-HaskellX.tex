
\subsection{UTCP Syntax}

We start by defining the syntax of our language
\[
   P ::= A \mid P \pseq P \mid P \parallel P \mid P \pcond P \mid \piter P
\]
and assign them pretty printing precedences,
so they work well with the definitions in modules
\texttt{StdPrecedences} and \texttt{StdUTPPrecedences}.
\begin{code}
precPCond = 5 + precSpacer  1
precPPar  = 5 + precSpacer  2
precPSeq  = 5 + precSpacer  3
precPIter = 5 + precSpacer  6
\end{code}
The \texttt{precSpacer} function is used to leave space between precedence
values so that new constructs can be given an in-between spacing,
if required. Currently it returns its argument times 1.


\subsection{UTCP Alphabet}

As already stated, the theory alphabet is $s,s',ls,ls',g,in,out$.
We declare each as a variable in our expression notation,
noting that Haskell allows identifiers to contain dashes,
which proves very convenient:
\begin{code}
s' = Var "s'"
\end{code}
Note, here \texttt{s'} is a Haskell variable of type \texttt{Expr},
while \texttt{"s'"} is a Haskell literal value of type \texttt{String}.

We have two ways to classify UTP observation variables.
Along one axis we distinguish observations of program variable
values (``script'' variables, e.g. $s$, $s'$) from those that record other
observations such as termination/stability,
or traces/refusals (``model'' variables, e.g. $ls$, $ls'$).
On the other axis we distinguish observations
that are dynamic, whose values change as the program runs
(e.g. $s$, $ls$ with $s'$ and $ls'$)
from those that are static,
unchanged during program execution (e.g. $g$, $in$ and $out$).
We have pre-defined names for these categories,
and a function \texttt{stdAlfDictGen} that
builds all the appropriate entries
given three lists of script, dynamic model and static variable strings.
We also declare that the predicate variables $A$, $B$ and $C$
will refer to atomic state-changes,
and so only have alphabet $\setof{s,s'}$.
\begin{code}
alfUTCPDict
 = dictMrg dictAlpha dictAtomic
 where
   dictAlpha = stdAlfDictGen ["s"] ["ls"] ["g","in","out"]
   dictAtomic = makeDict [ pvarEntry "A" ss'
                         , pvarEntry "B" ss'
                         , pvarEntry "C" ss' ]
   ss' = ["s", "s'"]
\end{code}

\texttt{CalcAlphabets}
, \texttt{CalcPredicates}
, \texttt{StdPredicates}.)
